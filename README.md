# dotfiles
Dotfiles.

# Install
I assume ~/.local/ to hold the 'dotfiles' directory and repo. It shouldn't matter.
```
mkdir ~/.local && cd ~/.local
git clone https://github.com/jhgorse/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```
# Usage
```
make help
make list      # show files we can link
make install
# try it out... do stuff. and then go back
make uninstall
```
